This is the master repository for the InishTech Software Potential Service Acceptance Test suite.

At present, this is used against internal builds of the Service as it's being developed.

It is intended to mirror these appropriate editions/subsets of these acceptance tests onto the [Software Potential github](https://github.com/InishTech/) as items get deployed to production and are considered ready for use.
